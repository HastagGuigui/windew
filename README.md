# windew! :>

windew, in your terminal!

## Requirements:

- Python 3 (doesn't really matter what 3.X, tho a supported one is recommended)
- a command line (cmd, powershell, whatever really)

## How to use:

```sh
python ./windew.py
```
(If for some reason windew doesn't render correctly, you can also use the lite version, which removes color changes :)
```sh
python ./windew_lite.py
```
